# The Original GoAnimate Character Dump
This repository contains a dump of XML snippets created by the Legacy GoAnimate character creator, which were extracted with a source code a while ago. More characters that weren't save which were either found or recreated are being added onto the archive as time goes depending on the ids for each character. These dump files, located in the `characters` directory, are grouped into granules of 1,000.  They are purposed to be accessed by any LVM services such as Wrapper: Offline.

Credit goes to VisualPlugin for the original source code used to extract character XML snippets & for the original repository.
