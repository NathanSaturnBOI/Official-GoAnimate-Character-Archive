# The Official GoAnimate Character Dump
This repository contains a dump of XML snippets created by the legacy GoAnimate character creator, which were extracted with a source code a while ago. More characters that weren't save which were either found or recreated are being added onto the archive as time goes. These dump files, located in the `characters` directory, are grouped into granules of 1,000.  They are purposed to be accessed by a service such as Wrapper: Offline.
